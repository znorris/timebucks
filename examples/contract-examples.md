# Contract Language Examples Using TimeBucks Notation

## 1. Rental Agreement with Inflation Protection

### Traditional Problematic Language:
> "Monthly rent shall be $2,000 per month for the first year, adjusted annually for inflation thereafter."

**Problems:** 
- What inflation measure?
- Which base year?
- How is "inflation" calculated?

### TimeBucks Solution:
> "Monthly rent shall be $2,000@2024[CPI] per month for the first year. Beginning January 1, 2025, monthly rent shall be $2,000@2024 →[CPI] $X@2025[CPI:2024], calculated using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Subsequent years shall follow the same methodology: $X@year →[CPI] $Y@(year+1)[CPI:year]."

**Benefits:**
- Clear methodology (CPI-U)
- Transparent base year (2024)
- Verifiable calculation
- Preserves purchasing power intent

## 2. Employment Contract with Real Wage Protection

### Traditional Problematic Language:
> "Annual salary of $75,000, with cost-of-living adjustments reviewed annually."

**Problems:**
- Discretionary "reviews" 
- Undefined "cost-of-living"
- No guaranteed adjustment method

### TimeBucks Solution:
> "Annual salary shall be $75,000@2024[CPI], representing the employee's protected purchasing power. Annual adjustments shall maintain this purchasing power: $75,000@2024 →[CPI] $X@2025[CPI:2024] for year 2025, and continuing annually thereafter. CPI calculations shall use the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), with adjustments effective January 1 of each year."

**Benefits:**
- Guarantees real wage protection
- Eliminates discretionary reviews
- Provides calculation formula
- Creates enforceable standard

## 3. Long-term Service Agreement

### Traditional Problematic Language:
> "Maintenance services shall be provided for $500 per month for the duration of this 10-year agreement, with prices subject to reasonable adjustments for inflation."

**Problems:**
- Subjective "reasonable adjustments"
- No defined inflation measure
- Potential for disputes

### TimeBucks Solution:
> "Maintenance services shall be provided for $500@2024[CPI] per month, representing the agreed-upon value in 2024 purchasing power. Monthly fees shall be adjusted annually to maintain this purchasing power: $500@2024 →[CPI] $X@2025[CPI:2024] for year 2025, and continuing annually thereafter throughout the 10-year term. Adjustments shall be calculated using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and shall be effective January 1 of each year."

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates subjective adjustments
- Provides clear calculation method
- Prevents value erosion over time
- Reduces potential disputes

## 4. Construction Contract with Material Cost Protection

### Traditional Problematic Language:
> "Total project cost: $1,000,000, subject to adjustment for material cost increases."

**Problems:**
- Undefined "material cost increases"
- No measurement methodology
- Potential for disputes

### TimeBucks Solution:
> "Total project cost: $1,000,000@2024[CPI], representing the agreed-upon value in 2024 purchasing power. If project completion extends beyond December 31, 2024, the contract value shall be adjusted to maintain purchasing power: $1,000,000@2024 →[CPI] $X@completion_year[CPI:2024]. Material cost escalation beyond general inflation shall be documented separately and subject to the change order process defined in Section 7."

**Benefits:**
- Separates general inflation from material-specific increases
- Provides clear base year
- Maintains contract value integrity
- Reduces dispute potential

## 5. Insurance Policy with Inflation Protection

### Traditional Problematic Language:
> "Coverage limit: $500,000, with annual increases to account for inflation."

**Problems:**
- Undefined inflation measure
- No calculation method
- Potential coverage gaps

### TimeBucks Solution:
> "Coverage limit: $500,000@2024[CPI], representing the protected coverage value in 2024 purchasing power. Annual coverage adjustments shall maintain this purchasing power: $500,000@2024 →[CPI] $X@2025[CPI:2024] for policy year 2025, and continuing annually thereafter. Adjustments shall be calculated using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and shall be effective on each policy anniversary date."

**Benefits:**
- Maintains real coverage value
- Eliminates coverage erosion
- Provides clear calculation method
- Ensures consistent protection

## 6. Alimony Agreement with Purchasing Power Protection

### Traditional Problematic Language:
> "Monthly alimony payments of $3,000, with periodic adjustments for cost of living."

Annual payments shall maintain this purchasing power: Year 1: $1,000,000@2024[CPI]; Year 2: $1,000,000@2024 →[CPI] $X@2025[CPI:2024]; continuing annually.
